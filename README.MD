## The Odin Project Library

This is a simple library app. The purpose of this project is to practice work with objects and object contructors. It is the first project in The Odin Projects [Javascript path](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript).

When user adds a book to the "library" a new object is created and added to the library array. A card representing the book is added to the DOM tree and user can manipulate the read / not read values for the book and also remove it (both from the DOM and the object array).


## What I learned during this project:

- creating object constructors and placing objects into an array
- how .this is used when constructing objects
- assigning unique identifiers to objects and DOM elements using crypto.randomUUID()
- linking objects in array to elements in the DOM tree and using these nodes to allow the user to manipulate objects

## What I intend to improve later on

- currently the app does not have any storage solution. I intend to return to this project once I have grasp of backend concepts that allow me to implement this.
- overall design is simple and not very polished
